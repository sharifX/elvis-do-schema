Digital Object Schema for ELViS

This repository is part of the [DiSSCo](https://dissco.eu) project. One of the services under development is ELViS (European Loans and Visit System) which will unify access requests to all specimens in collections in Europe (490Mio of 21 [Synthesys+](http://www.synthesys.info/) institutions to start with), integrate a live data dashboard reporting on collection data and access, and it will deliver improved management on loans and for digitization on demand workflows. 

Here we will store the [Digital Object](https://www.dona.net/digitalobjectarchitecture) schema under consideration and test. At the moment we are testing with [Cordra](https://cordra.org/).

Schemas: 

* Institutes 
* Facilities 
* Taxonomic-Expertise (for the instiitute) 
* Collection Summary 
* People 

These schema provides the structure for the digital object that will be created (this is the underlying architecture for all DiSSCo related services).
